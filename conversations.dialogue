Lucas: Hey, cousin! WELCOME TO BRAZIL! Have you enjoyed your trip?
Emil: Hi, Lucas. It has been long, but peaceful. I'm still getting used to the warm weather.
Lucas: You'll get used to it very very quickly! Summer here is intense, but full of goodness.
Lucas: You'll love the countryside. It's very different from the capital. 
Lucas: A calmer place, more nature... and the food is fantastic! It hits different! 
Emil: I hope so. Everything here is so... a bit new at the moment. I'm a bit anxious.
Lucas: Relax, man. We'll help you feel at home. 
Lucas: And by the way, Grandma Laila is waiting you to prepare a snack for us. 
Lucas: You should see her and ask if Grandma needs any help. 
Emil: Now? I should pack my things first. It's been a long trip...
Lucas: Don't worry, cous! I'll take the bags to the bedroom. Go and give Grandma a pep talk!

Emil: Hi, Grandma. Is everything alright?
Laila: Oh, Emil, darling. I'm fine, just a bit nostalgic. It's been so long since I've seen you!
Laila: I think about how little you were and how much you've grown! 
Laila: Enjoy your youth as it passes quickly!
Emil: I don't even know how to enjoy it as much as you did... 
Emil: Sometimes I feel confused about how to really enjoy it. 
Emil: Maybe it's good to just live for the moment, as you say.
Laila: Ah, my grandson, youth is such a precious time. 
Laila: It's a time of discovery, of learning and growing. 
Laila: Life can be wonderful if you learn to appreciate the little moments.
Emil: You're absolutely right! Grandma, do you need any help cooking?
Emil: Lucas said you were waiting for me to prepare a snack. 
Emil: I think cooking could be a whole new experience.
Laila: That's lovely to hear, Emil. I'm making cheese bread. Have you ever heard of it?
Emil: Cheese bread? No. What's this?
Laila: It's a typical local delight. 
Laila: It's a dough made from starch, cheese, milk and eggs. 
Laila: It's baked until it's golden and crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside.
Laila: The recipe is very simple. We mix the starch with hot milk, butter and eggs.
Laila: Then we add the grated cheese. Mash well, shape into balls and bake.
Laila: Shall we begin?
Emil: One second, Grandma!
Lucas: Go give Grandma a hand, bro! I already put your things away.
Eino: Hi, grandson! Stop being lazy and go help your grandma.

Laila: Many thanks for your help, my grandson!
Laila: I learned this recipe from my mother's neighbor. 
Laila: It was a special moment, we would pause in time to drink coffee and eat this snack.
Laila: I remember those simple days when life seemed slower and fuller.
Emil: That sounds wonderful, Grandma. 
Emil: Food really does have a way of bringing people together, doesn't it?
Laila: My mother always used food to connect with her neighbors.
Laila: It was a way of showing affection and friendship. 
Laila: Those simple moments were the ones that brought most happiness.
Emil: You never went to college, Grandma, but you seem so wise. Your happiness is inspiring!
Laila: Life has taught me a lot, Emil. 
Laila: But the most important thing is to find what makes you happiest. 
Laila: Everyone has their own path. I'm glad you're here, exploring and seeking your own happiness.
Emil: Grandma, I feel so inspired by all the kindness and affection I've received here. 
Emil: I'd like to give something back. 
Emil: I'm going to teach Lucas how to make karjalanpiirakka, a typical Finnish dish.
Laila: That's lovely, Emil! I'm sure he'll appreciate it. 
Laila: It's a great way to share a bit of your culture with him.

Emil: Hey, Lucas...I was thinking... you've been so welcoming and supportive. 
Emil: At first, I felt hesitant and doubtful about what it would be like with you guys.
Emil: But now I'm extremely grateful for the affection I've received.
Emil: I'd like to make some nice memories with you too. How about cooking together? 
Emil: I'll teach you how to make karjalanpiirakka.
Lucas: Karjala... what? That sounds interesting. I'm up for it! What do we need to do?
Emil: Karjalanpiirakka. These are typical Finnish rice cakes. 
Emil: The recipe is simple: we make a thin rye dough, fill it with a creamy rice porridge and bake it.
Emil: It's traditional and delicious.
Lucas: Wow, that sounds great! Come on, buddy. Show me the way.

Emil: Actually, Lucas, I learned this recipe at school with my friends.
Emil: In Finland, we have cooking classes where we learn traditional recipes.
Emil: It was a really exciting experience. 
Emil: Cooking with friends always makes the process more special.
Emil: It gets me thinking about college. 
Emil: Meeting new people and learning from them is one of the best parts of life.
Emil: In university I could find many opportunities to learn and grow up.
Emil: Both in my personal as well as professional life. 
Emil: Who knows, maybe I could even apply to gastronomy? I'm quite good at it.
Lucas: You're right, coz. 
Lucas: College can be a great place to explore new things and discover more about yourself.
Lucas: And who knows, you could open a Brazilian restaurant in Finland!
Emil: That's true. I think I can learn a lot and also share what I know.
Emil: That's what I've realized even during my short stay... 
Emil: the cross-cultural exchange is incredibly valuable.
Emil: The more we open ourselves up to new experiences, the more we grow.
Lucas: I'm glad you're feeling that way, Emil.
Lucas: It's important to follow your heart and explore new possibilities.
Lucas: Life is full of unexpected surprises. 
Lucas: And we'll always be here to support you, Emil. 
Lucas: Now let's eat, because this looks really delicious!

Emil: When I first came here, I was nervous, full of uncertainty and afraid of the unknown.
Emil: But now I feel different. More confident, more at ease. 
Emil: What about you, player? How do you feel about the future? 
Emil: Sometimes life is much more about living and experiencing than choices. 
Emil: It's a bit of a clichÃ© what I'm about to say, but...
Emil: Living the process with people who are important has made me realize...
Emil: ...that my path is being built at the right time. 
Emil: Now, I prefer to focus on what matters, living moments with people I care about.
Emil: That way, I'll be prepared to go through any perish in my life.
Emil: I've learned that change can bring great opportunities. 
Emil: That new experiences and connections can truly transform us.
Emil: Every moment, every person we meet, has the potential to teach us something valuable.
Emil: So remember to enjoy every moment. 
Emil: Find your happiness in the little things and open yourself up to new possibilities.
Emil: Because it's through these that we discover hidden parts of ourselves.
Emil: And what we want for our tomorrow.
Emil: Well... at least I managed to discover a lot. 
Emil: Thank you for following me on this journey.
Emil: And may you also find the courage to live fully, here and now. 
Emil: And if you can, with some company and something to eat.
